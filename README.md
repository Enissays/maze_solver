# Console Maze Solver

**This is the first prototype of a project I made for a freelance client, this can be updated and changed anytime**


# How to run it ?


1 - The program must be compiled with GCC first then executed

2 - The console will then ask you for theses properties :

    + (row) (col)
    + (start_row) (start_col)
    + (end_row) (end_col)
    + (number of full cells)
      - (cell_row) (cell_col)
3 - The program will then draw the maze displaying the start cell with A and the end cell with B
    Then it will display all the possible paths concatenated and all possibles deplacements sorted by alphabetical order using quicksort
